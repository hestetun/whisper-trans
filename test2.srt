00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
AlQ放心

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The morning, dawn, wind, lightning, etc.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The clouds, the waves of light, away the light of the light.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The clouds, the waves of light, out of the clouds.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And after that, the clouds, the waves of light, out of the clouds.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You asked, will you be there, far between the two words of the meaning?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Of course, you went to Google's place and you got there far away.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then I met the clouds, the waves, the waves.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The clouds, the waves of the meaning, between the moon and the moon.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I said, may God not forgive anything from all this.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So the question is both of our questions in a very complicated way.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I asked Dr. Majid Harb, Dr. Salah Darausha,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I sent him an email from the two words of the meaning,

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so I asked him, may God not forgive anything from all this.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I said, may God not forgive anything from all this.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I remember this in the Arabic language

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that I wrote in her poem, Mundo Salatina, a year ago.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Did you find any problem in the problem of the waves?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The idea of the waves in the problem of the waves

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is that they start from the idea that the waves of light

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or the design thinking.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The problem that the waves of the waves have is

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
how to learn the Arabic language and learn it.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How can I learn all of them

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and to express the Arabic language,

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
near habitation and experiences,

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
or even contact them to do so?

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How can I inspire my studies

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to tell you and ask?

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How can I teach in my life

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and to teach in the Arabic language

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and to teach in the Arabic language

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and how can I inspire them

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to do so?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How can I inspire my studies,

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
my studies, my studies, my studies?

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How can I inspire my studies to tell you

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the life, my studies,

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
my studies, my studies

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and to teach in the Arabic language

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which gives me institution

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and building and building

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and building and building

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
As a topic that invariable

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
among others

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
face its death

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A further scientific question

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
approach

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,000
In performance

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
4 people use to work at a performance

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
including these events

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
will be opened faster

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but also

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
with these events

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and the person who is not aware of the situation

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and he is ready to start

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
with the question of what this event is

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
of course, the first thing we do with it

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is to say if it is a picture

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
2, if it is a picture

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
3, if it is a picture

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the second is to say if it is a picture

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the fifth of the picture

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I do not know what the situation is

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I said when I asked

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I asked

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
if it is a picture

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
because it is a picture

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and this is the idea of thinking

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
or when we think

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
what is a picture

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and a picture

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
or is it a picture

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
from here I ask

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
if we think

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
what is a picture

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the Arabic language

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the Arabic language

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
is a picture

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and it is a picture

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and we can see

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that we can't make it

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
or it is a picture

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the second is

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we know

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
from what we love

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
when we love something

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
we know

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that it is a picture

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and we know

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that it is a picture

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and we know

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that it is a picture

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and it is a picture

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that we love

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that's why I say to everyone

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I want to tell you

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I want to tell them

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
they love them

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and I will tell them

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
from their Arabic

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
third

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
here

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
there are five languages

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
a part of the main history

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of humanity

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,020
meaning

108
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,060
these languages are an instruction

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,880
the University, the Arabic scholars

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
is always Skype

112
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,040
about the Arabic tava

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,720
It is Joh

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,940
as We are talking We are the socks

115
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,980
�

116
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,000
as the Arabic language

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,420
but as a sign

118
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:39,840
as a settlement

119
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,800
as the Quran

120
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,480
so imagine

121
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,140
in an easy situation

122
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,320
the time of theensions

123
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,020
is it possible for you to bring on the uniform?

124
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,500
is it possible that today

125
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,580
the Constitution

126
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,260
isn't necessary on this occasion

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,500
should it be possible

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,220
orabilите

129
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,640
of self-????

130
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:18,300
UNIVERSITY

131
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,220
We decided to cross the border

132
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,480
with your meeting

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,040
but about that

134
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,200
I want to thank you

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,540
for your well-being

136
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,240
I want to thank you

137
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Is it possible

138
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,480
you is

139
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,980
没 living a和i

140
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,080
so

141
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,040
that it consists of keith

142
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,300
the Arabs

143
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,440
and all people are satisfied

144
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
so it is the Arabs

145
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,440
this is what we are going to talk about

146
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
peace and blessings of Allah

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
this is a very dangerous word

148
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
and a very dangerous word

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
and a very dangerous word

150
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
and a very dangerous word

151
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
and a very dangerous word

152
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
the second thing

153
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
is that the Arabs

154
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
or that they are Arabs

155
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
is not an ethnic group

156
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
or an ethnic group

157
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
or a religion

158
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
and a geographical group

159
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
a group of people

160
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
in the country

161
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
and in our own country

162
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
any group

163
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
in the Arab country

164
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
is an Arab region

165
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
the Arab country

166
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
is a country

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
for today

168
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
it is located

169
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
in the Crystal

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
which is located

171
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
no one is there

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
and no one is there

173
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
except for the religion

174
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
in the very important

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
and in the days

176
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
we do not use this

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
or the word

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
it is not

179
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
and we do not use the Arab language

180
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
the word

181
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
it is not

182
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
the Arab language

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
is a language

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
is up

185
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,940
I saw my stupid

186
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,440
paper

187
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
with such money

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
and I a human

189
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
and for 20 of my kids

190
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
they lived in America

191
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
15 years

192
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
I told people

193
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
from my home

194
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,440


195
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
and from the home

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,440


197
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
and anywhere

198
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,480
with a bunch of

199
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,440
people

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I saw the man

201
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
with a lot of money

202
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
and he took all day

203
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
he cried

204
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
he cried

205
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
he cried

206
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
he cried

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
he cried

208
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
he cried

209
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
he cried

210
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
he cried

211
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
he cried

212
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
he cried

213
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
he cried

214
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
he cried

215
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
but in every country

216
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I went to him

217
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
and in my home

218
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
and in every place

219
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
I was with the Arab world

220
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
until in the last days

221
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I was with myself

222
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
and I realized

223
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
that the Arab world

224
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
is mine

225
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
thank you

226
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
you
